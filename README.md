## This Python program is designed to run on the TI-84 Plus CE Python Edition Calculator

### Current Release

* Version 4

### Description

This Python program accepts either Metric (cm & kg) or English (inches & pounds) values to calculate a patient's BSA, and then uses this calculated BSA to compute dosing levels typically used during the Lymphodepletion phase for Multiple Myeloma patients undergoing CAR-T Cell Therapy.
